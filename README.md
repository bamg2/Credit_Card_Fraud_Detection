 This repository contains a comprehensive project on detecting fraudulent transactions in a highly imbalanced credit card dataset. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost). Key features:

Data Analysis: Distribution analysis of features like transaction amount and time, along with fraud/non-fraud comparisons.
Preprocessing: Feature scaling and stratified train-test split to handle class imbalance.
Modeling: Training and evaluation of multiple models, with XGBoost achieving optimal performance.
Evaluation Metrics: Confusion matrices, classification reports, and accuracy scores for validation.
The repository also provides the saved XGBoost model and a script to load and use it for predictions.
