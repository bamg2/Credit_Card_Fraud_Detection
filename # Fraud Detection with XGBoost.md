# Fraud Detection with XGBoost

This project applies machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data. The dataset contains anonymized features representing transactions, and the goal is to classify each transaction as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

## Files in this repository:

- `data/creditcard.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the models.
- `scripts/data_exploration.py`: Exploratory data analysis and visualizations.
- `scripts/model_training.py`: Training and evaluating models using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- `scripts/model_saving.py`: Saving the trained XGBoost model.
- `models/xgboost_model.joblib`: The trained XGBoost model.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## How to run:
